# Crop Sown Registry

An installable **Crop Sown Registry** built as a thin extension of the OpenG2P
[registry platform](https://github.com/OpenG2P/registry-platform), following the
same inverted build model as the
[Farmer Registry](https://github.com/OpenG2P/farmer-registry): the platform
publishes the runnable base images and the `openg2p-registry` Helm chart; this
repo adds **only** the crop sown domain on top.

The domain is ported from the Odoo module `g2p_crop_registry` (`g2p.crop.registry`
and its planning / cultivation / sowing / harvesting lines) onto the platform's
register model.

## What this repo owns

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cropsown-extension/` | The crop sown domain package — models, schemas, services, seed metadata (registers, AWE policy, DCI templates) |
| `dashboard-ui/` | The Crop Sown Registry analytics dashboard (the view behind the portal's Dashboard button) |
| `docker/` | Thin Dockerfiles (`FROM openg2p/openg2p-registry-*` + `pip install cropsown-extension`) selected at runtime by `REGISTRY_EXTENSION_MODULE` (Option C). `docker/staff-ui/` also injects the Dashboard header button; `docker/dashboard-ui/` builds the analytics app. |
| `helm/openg2p-cropsown-registry/` | A thin wrapper chart: pins `openg2p-registry` as a dependency and supplies the crop sown values overlay (no templates) |
| `docker-compose.yml`, `local/` | Docker Compose stack for running the registry on a laptop (`local/` holds its env file and the mock master-data catalog API) |
| `test/sanity/` | The crop sown **field-specific** sanity tests (Set 2); the harness + generic tests are inherited from the platform sanity image |

## Registers

Modelled on the **CROP SOWN REGISTRY ERD UPDATED** diagram. The crop sown record
is the hub: every crop line links directly to it. Land is not a register of its
own — a crop sown record covers exactly one plot, whose attributes and geometry
sit flat on the record.

```
CropSown                     farmer identifiers, the plot (land_uuid/land_id, ownership, soil fertility,
                             area, geo), status, production year, lifecycle stage
├── Planning                 season, crop, planned area/seed/fertilizer, expected yield
├── Cultivation              land preparation, actual planted date/area/seed/fertilizer
├── Sowing                   sowing status, area sown, sowing date, seed type, machinery
├── Production               growth stage, area under production, actual yield, yield per ha
├── Harvest                  maturity, harvest date, area/quantity harvested, loss, stored, sold
├── Infestation              growth stage, pest/weed/disease, severity, damage, action taken
└── Cluster                  cluster name/status, agro-ecological zone, area, smallholders
```

Neither land nor farmers are registers here. The plot's `land_uuid` (generated)
stays the key every crop line references, but it now names the plot described by
its parent crop sown record rather than a row in a separate land register.

Farmers are **not** a register here: the crop sown record carries their
identifiers (`farmer_uuid`, `farmer_id`, `fayda_fan_id`, `farmer_name`) and
mirrors the Fayda FAN into `link_foundational_id`, because this system is not the
system of record for farmers.

Each register has a `G2PRegister*`, a `G2PRegisterHistory*` and a
`G2PIntakeForm*` model, a matching pydantic schema trio, and a domain service
that validates the domain attributes and builds `search_text` / `record_name`.
Every field, section and tab carries a human-readable label. Catalogs and lookup
tables from the ERD are seeded as attribute lookups — see
[cropsown-extension/README.md](cropsown-extension/README.md) for the full mapping.

## Documentation

- [The Record Photo Chain](docs/record-photo-chain.md) — how record photos
  reach the browser, and the five places that chain breaks. Registry-agnostic;
  useful to any OpenG2P registry wiring up images.

## Run it locally

```bash
docker compose --env-file local/.env up -d --build
```

Then open the **Staff Portal at http://portal.localtest.me:3020** and log in with
`admin` / `admin`. The header's **Dashboard** button opens the Crop Sown Registry
analytics view at http://dashboard.localtest.me:3021 (its Back button returns you
to the portal page you left). The dashboard reads this stack's registry database
directly, so it shows the records the portal holds and nothing else — a registry
with no crop sown records renders empty panels. See `dashboard-ui/README.md`.

The stack runs the whole login chain — Keycloak (realm `staff`), the IAM staff
API and master data — alongside the registry, so this is a real OIDC login and
the registry resolves the user's roles into permissions exactly as a deployment
does. Staff API on http://localhost:8001/docs, Partner API on
http://localhost:8002/docs, mock crop catalogue on http://localhost:8010/docs.
See [local/README.md](local/README.md) for the full service list and how the
pieces fit together.

## Deploy

```bash
helm repo add openg2p https://openg2p.github.io/openg2p-helm
helm dependency build ./helm/openg2p-cropsown-registry
helm install cropsown-registry ./helm/openg2p-cropsown-registry \
  --set global.registryHostname=cropsown-registry.example.org
```

Set `registry.sanity.runE2e=true` to run the end-to-end sanity suite after install.

## Version pinning

The `openg2p-registry` base image tag (`RP_VERSION` in each Dockerfile) and the
chart dependency version in `helm/openg2p-cropsown-registry/Chart.yaml` are
**hardcoded and pinned together**. The crop sown images and the wrapper chart are
versioned in lockstep by CI (one version per commit).

To see which version it would pick, run `./scripts/bump-rp-version.sh -n` (dry-run,
writes nothing); `-h` prints help. To apply, run `./scripts/bump-rp-version.sh`
(latest published version) or `./scripts/bump-rp-version.sh <version>` — it updates
the Dockerfiles and the chart dependency together, so they can never drift. A CI
check (`test/test_rp_pin_lockstep.py`) fails the build if they ever do.

See the deployment & extension docs at [docs.openg2p.org](https://docs.openg2p.org).
