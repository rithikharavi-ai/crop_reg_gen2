// SQL behind the Crop Sown Registry dashboard.
//
// Every panel reads this registry's own tables — the ones the Staff Portal writes
// to — so the dashboard shows whatever the registry currently holds and nothing
// else. There is no fixture, sample constant or fallback dataset anywhere in this
// path: an empty registry renders empty panels.
//
// Shape of the data (cropsown-extension/register_domain/models):
//
//   g2p_register_crop_sowns   one row per farmer-plot-season registration. Holds
//                             the farmer's identifiers and the administrative
//                             address (region/zone/woreda/kebele).
//   g2p_register_sowings      the sowing lines beneath a registration, linked by
//                             link_internal_record_id. Holds the crop, the area
//                             sown and the plot's ownership type.
//
// Geography and ownership are stored as lookup keys ("REGION_ET07",
// "OWNERSHIP_TYPE_OWNER"), so both are resolved through g2p_attribute_values:
// value_display gives the label to render and value_code gives the P-code the
// choropleth matches its boundaries on. Where a lookup has no row — the crop
// commodity catalogue is served externally and is not seeded locally — the stored
// key is shown rather than inventing a label for it.

/** Filters the API accepts. Geography arrives as P-codes; see convertPcodesToValueIds. */
