-- Crop sown functional ids carry the cropping season: REG/S{1-4}/{year}/{00000}.
--
-- The season lives on the root record because the id is minted before any crop
-- line exists to derive it from. The bulk sample data predates that column, so
-- rather than restate 500 ids as literals this derives them the same way the
-- id generator does — from the record's own season, falling back to the season
-- its planning line already uses.
--
-- Runs after 40_bulk_records.sql. Idempotent: only rows still on the old
-- CROP/REG/ prefix are rewritten.

-- 1. Every registration belongs to the season its crop plan is for.
