"""Idempotent injection of the sanity crop sown record into the registry database.

Why SQL and not an API:
  * every staff-portal-api register write is a **change request** — using it to
    build a fixture would mean creating and approving a CR before the DCI test
    could run, entangling two tests;
  * the record must exist in a known, ACTIVE, already-approved state so the DCI
    search is deterministic.

Why the test data is injected at all rather than reusing seeded sample data: the
crop sown sample records are only present when the sample-data set is applied,
which a production install does not do — the e2e must not depend on them.

**`search_text` is written explicitly.** On the ORM it is auto-populated by
SQLAlchemy event listeners, which do NOT fire for raw SQL. db-seed's
load_sample_data.py has the same constraint and does the same thing. The DCI
search is `search_text ILIKE '%<text>%'`, so this column is what makes the
injected record findable.
