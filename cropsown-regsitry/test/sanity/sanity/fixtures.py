"""Canonical identifiers for everything the sanity e2e creates.

Every row the suite writes carries one of these markers, so the whole fixture
set can be found — and later deleted — with a single predicate per table. The
suite deliberately does NOT clean up after itself: the records are left in place
so a failed run can be inspected. See `TEARDOWN_SQL` for the removal statements.

Nothing here may collide with seeded sample data: the `SANITY` marker never
appears in the crop sown sample set, and the ids are fixed UUIDs so a re-run
updates rather than duplicates.
