# End-to-end DCI search through the full PEP path:
#   partner signs the DCI envelope + an embedded consent JWS with its PM key ->
#   registry verifies the envelope (PM key) -> registry calls Consent Manager
#   /validate for the consent JWS -> registry renders each record through the
#   register's outgoing DCI template -> registry clamps the rendered record to
#   the consented scopes.
#
# The record searched for is the sanity crop sown record injected by the data-seed
# Job, so these assertions never depend on the sample data set being applied.
#
# Crop Sown field-specific test (Set 2): the crop sown DCI template
# (openg2p_cropsown_to_dci) nests the farmer identity under
# <scope>.farmer_info.demographic_info and carries the registration's own
# attributes (production_year, status, lifecycle_stage) at the scope root. The
# land and the crop lines are separate top-level scopes (farm_details,
# crop_production_details, ...), which the clamping test asserts are withheld.
